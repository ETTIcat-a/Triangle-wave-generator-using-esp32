# Triangle-wave-generator-using-esp32

The project isn't compiled or builded just copy paste into Arduino IDE, install bluetooth package or whatever is missing and no recognized(check bottom info box from IDE - tipically check errors).

All code comms are written in romanian bcs it was final project after being electronics engineer student for 1 year so SORRY FOR THAT.

Some user instructions:

You must install any Andoird/IOS terminal app like this(for Android) https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.kai_morich.serial_bluetooth_terminal&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1

Basically, after uploading the code on esp32, type an amplitude value between 0 - 3.3V(VCC), and a frequency(i don't remember max value but it isn't so high).
